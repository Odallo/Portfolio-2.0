          <p>
            I&apos;m a software developer focused on building reliable, scalable,
            and user-centered applications. I enjoy turning complex problems
            into clean, practical solutions.
          </p>

          <p>
            My background spans frontend and backend development, with hands-on
            experience using modern tools like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python,
            and cloud-ready architectures.
          </p>

          <p>
            I care deeply about code quality, clarity, and continuous learning —
            and I&apos;m driven by building products that actually solve real-world
            problems.
